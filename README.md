[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

Gidana is a property discovery and rental platform built for Africa. It lets anyone search for studios, apartments, or houses within their budget, view photos, contact verified owners, book appointments, and manage contracts entirely in the cloud.

---

## Features

- **Property search** — filter by type (studio, apartment, house), location, price range, and availability
- **Photo galleries** — multi-image listings with a designated main photo
- **Verified owners** — authenticated accounts with profile pictures and contact info
- **Rental management** — create, track, and update rental agreements with status workflows
- **Favorites** — save and revisit properties of interest
- **Reviews** — tenants can leave ratings and written feedback on properties
- **Wallet & payments** — manage payment wallets, transfer money, and pay for services
- **Smart alerts** — set price/location alerts to be notified when matching listings appear
- **Search history** — logged-in users retain their search history for quick re-discovery
- **Firebase Storage** — optional cloud image storage via Firebase (falls back to local disk)

# Database — leave DATABASE_URL empty to use SQLite in dev
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/gidana_db
DB_PATH=gidana_dev.db

JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS=72

UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads/properties

# Firebase (optional)
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./firebase-credentials.json
FIREBASE_BUCKET=your-bucket.appspot.com
USE_FIREBASE=false

ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 4. Run the server
